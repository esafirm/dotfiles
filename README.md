## Esa's Dotfiles

> This is a readme directed mainly for me.

## Setup

The first thing you should remember is:

1. Generate yout SSH key
2. Update that key to remote repo (Github for dotfiles)
3. Clone dotfiles to `~/dotfiles`

You don't need to:

1. Install oh-my-zsh and set the theme manually
2. Set default login shell to zsh 


So what you've got to do is:

Run `./setup.sh` in `~/dotfiles`
Please read the script first when you want to run it.
